       <h1>Glen Park Canyon</h1>
       <p>Tucked in a little canyon between residential neighborhoods, Glen Canyon Park is a small open space parcel, but a delight for local dogwalkers and nature enthusiasts.
         Redtail hawks are frequently seen soaring above the park, owls nest in the trees, and raccoon, skunk, and possum paw prints smudge the dirt.
         On one visit, I spotted a northern alligator lizard basking in the sun.
         Although nonnative plants and poison oak are prominent, you also might see monkeyflowers and coyote brush.
         The biggest surprise (and most significant reason for keeping this canyon undeveloped) is Islais  Tunnel-like trailCreek, an actual stream running through the canyon.
         It may be the last naturally occurring, unobstructed creek in all of San Francisco.</p>
